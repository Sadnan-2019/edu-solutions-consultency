                  AUD 21.38 per hour, or $855.20 every two weeks. However, the
                  amount of money international students can earn depends on
                  various factors, such as the type of work, the number of hours
                  worked, and the industry. For example, the hourly minimum pay
                  for retail and hospitality positions is AUD 21.38. Part-time
                  jobs in Australia for international students can guarantee an
                  average hourly pay of AUD 34.62 or a monthly average salary of
                  AUD 67,500. International students with a valid student visa
                  can apply for a part-time job in Australia and work up to 48
                  hours a fortnight. They can work up to 20 hours per week while
                  school is in session, and there is no limit on the number of
                  hours an international student can work during recognized
                  school vacations

                  Yes, international students can stay in Canada after
                  graduation for up to three years with a post-graduation work
                  permit (PGWP). Starting February 15, 2024, students who
                  graduate from master's degree programs that are less than two
                  years (eight months minimum) may be eligible for a three-year
                  PGWP. This will give them more time to gain work experience

                  degree programs of less than two years may be eligible for a
                  three-year post-graduation work permit (PGWP). The length of
                  the PGWP depends on the length of the study program and the
                  passport's expiry date, whichever comes first. Here are some
                  other criteria for a PGWP in 2024: Lock-in date: Between
                  September 1, 2022, and August 31, 2024 Study time: At least
                  50% of the program must be completed in Canada, either online
                  or in class Time spent online: Time spent studying online from
                  outside of Canada before August 31, 2024, will count toward
                  the length of the PGWP as long as it constitutes less than 50%
                  of the program of study Age: Must be at least 18 years old
                  Student status: Must have held full time student status in
                  Canada during every academic session of the program of study
                  Transcript: Must have obtained a transcript and an official
                  letter from the Designated Learning Institution (DLI)
                  confirming the applicant has met all requirements to complete
                  their program of study The PGWP can take anywhere from 80 to
                  180 days to process..
